# URL Shortener App

An app built with React Native. Uses context API as central store instead of Redux. Includes reducers, action creators, and template for multiple contexts.

Still to do:

1. Convert to Typescript

   - add default state types
   - add types for api responses

2. Add Tests

3. Update README with better styling

Notes:

- Would not use Typescript throughout entire app, mainly just for central state and common api requests.
- Would not worry too much about creating tests in a first version, but should not proceed further without writing tests.
